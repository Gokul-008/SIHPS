## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
E-waste Collection Facility Locator: Develop a feature that allows users to find the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities based on their location. This could be done using Google Maps API or a similar mapping service. Users should be able to see facility details such as address, contact information, operating hours, and types of e-waste accepted.
